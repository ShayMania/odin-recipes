    <h1>Butter Chicken!!</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, (pronounced [mʊrg mək.kʰə.ni]) is an Indian dish.[1] It is
        a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its
        rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.[7]</p>

    <p> In 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In
        1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord
        Indian restaurant in Manhattan.</p>
