    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
        base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
        various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
        baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
        pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
    <p>In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and
        fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Toppings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices.</li>
        <li> Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the
            dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. </li>
        <li> There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.</li>
        <li>This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens.</li>
    </ol>
